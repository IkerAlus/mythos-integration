# polkadot-js-examples

Examples on how to handle foreign assets with [Polkadot-JS](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/).

To run these examples, simply cd into this directory and run `yarn build && yarn <keepAlive|transferAll|allowDeath>`.

An additional example on how to subscribe to a tx's events is present at [`transferWithTracking.ts`](./src/transferWithTracking.ts), but due to using `dev` accounts, it will fail if run.
